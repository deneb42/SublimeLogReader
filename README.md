 - A theme dedicated for Log reading. (Also compatible with Monoka√Ø, and also most probably compatible with your preferred theme)
 - Coloration for iOS ans Android logs depending on the log level
 - Inclusive and exclusive filtering

## Usage
### Coloration
The plugin will automatically color .alog (for Android) and .ilog (iOS) files.
Else, you can trigger the coloration by setting the syntax to either alog or ilog. 

To do that you have multiple solution :

 - On the lower right corner, select MobileLogReader/Android Logs / iOS Logs
 - "ctrl+shift+P" then "set syntax Android Logs" / "iOS Logs"  
   A quick way to do this is to type "ctrl+shift+P" "alog" Enter

### Filtering
You can filter the logs to either :

 - Remove the lines containing the text in your selection (multiple selection supported)
 - Keep only the lines containing the text in your selection (multiple selection supported)

To do that :

 - "ctrl+shift+x" to exclude lines containing your selection(s)
 - "ctrl+shift+c" to conserve lines containing your selection(s)
